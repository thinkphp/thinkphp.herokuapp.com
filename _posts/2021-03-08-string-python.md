In Python a string is a series, or sequence, of character in order. In this definition a character is anything you can type on thekeyboard in one keystroke, such as a letter
'a', 'b', 'c' or a number '1','2','3' or a special characters such as '\','#','$' etc. a space is also a character, altough it does not have a visible representation.

It should also be noted that strings are immutables. Immutable means that once a string has been created it cannot be changed. If you try to change a string you will in fact create a new string, containing whatever modifications you made, you will not affect the original stringin anyway; for the most part you can ignore this fact but it beans that if you try to get a substring or split a string you must remember to store the result - you will see later in this chapter.

To define the start and the end of a string we have used the single quote character ' thus all of the following are valid string:
'hello'
'hello world'
'Hello, Alexander!'
'to be or not to be that is the question!'

We can also define an empty string which has no characters in it (it is defined as a single quote followed immediately by a second quote with no gap between them). This is often used to initialise or reset a variable holding a reference to a string, for example.

some_string = ''
