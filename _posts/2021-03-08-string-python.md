In Python a string is a series, or sequence, of character in order. In this definition a character is anything you can type on thekeyboard in one keystroke, such as a letter
'a', 'b', 'c' or a number '1','2','3' or a special characters such as '\','#','$' etc. a space is also a character, altough it does not have a visible representation.
