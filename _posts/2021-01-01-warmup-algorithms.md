We'll begin our study of algorithms in a practical way, looking at four problems and multiple algorithmic solution for each problem. This lets us begin with one of the most important ideas in our field: not only are there many ways to solve a problem, but some solutions - we'll see - can be much more efficient than others.

## First example: Factorial


```python
# iteration
def factorial( n ):
    r = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        r *= i
    return r

>>> factorial(5)
>>>120    

```
