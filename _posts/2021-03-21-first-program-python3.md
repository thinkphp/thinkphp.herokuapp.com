## Ce este un algoritm?

### Def1:

A set of instructions, or rules that, start with initial data, solves a class of problems using precise operations, executed mechanically, without creative human intervation.

To qualify as an algorithm, the set of instructions should have some properties:

1- preciseness - or non-ambiguity. Each step must be non-ambiguous and executable without creative intervention.
2- generality - it should solve a class of problems, not just one particular problem.
3- finiteness - the algorithm must finish in a finite amount of time.
4- correctness - the end result should be correct for all inputs.
