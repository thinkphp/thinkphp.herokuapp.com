## Ce este un algoritm?

### Definition1:

A set of instructions, or rules that, start with initial data, solves a class of problems using precise operations, executed mechanically, without creative human intervention.

To qualify as an algorithm, the set of instructions should have some properties:

- preciseness - or non-ambiguity. Each step must be non-ambiguous and executable without creative intervention.
- generality - it should solve a class of problems, not just one particular problem.
- finiteness - the algorithm must finish in a finite amount of time.
- correctness - the end result should be correct for all inputs.

A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the rootof a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation such as searching or replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or playing a video.

The details look different in different languages, buta few instructions appear in just about every language:

Input - get the data from keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device

output - display the data on the screen, save it in a file, sent it over the network

math - perform basic mathematical operations like addition or multiplication

conditional execution - check for certain conditions and run the appropriete code

repetition - perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Traditionally, the first program you right in a new language is called "Hello World!" because all it does is display the words "Hello worlds!". In Python it looks like
this:
```python
>>> print("Hello, world!")
```

This is an exampleof a print statement, althought it doesn t actually print anything on paper. It display a result on the screen. In this case, the result is the words: Hello, world!

The quotations marks in the program mark the beginning and the end of the text to be displayed; they do not appear in the result. The parentheses indicate that print is a function.
