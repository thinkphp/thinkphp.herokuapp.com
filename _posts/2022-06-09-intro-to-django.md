1. Introduction

Django is a Python Framework that make it easier to create web sites using Python. Django take care of
the difficult stuff so you can concentrate on building
your web applications. Django emphasizes reusability
of components, also refereed to as DRY (Do not repeat yourself) and comes with ready-to-use features like
login system, database connections and CRUD operations.
(Create Read Update Delete). Django is especially helpul for database driven websites.

Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template):
- Model (the data you want to present, usally the data from a database)
- View (a request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user)
- Template (a text file like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.
