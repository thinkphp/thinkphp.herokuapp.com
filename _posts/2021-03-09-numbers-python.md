# Introduction

In this chapter we will explore the different way that numbers can be represented by built-in types in Python. We will also introduce the Boolean type used to represent True and False. As part of this discussion we will also
look at both numeric and assignment operators in Python. We will conclude by introducing the special value known
as None.

## Type of Numbers

There are three types used to represent numbers in Python; these are integers types, floating points numbers and complex numbers.
This begs the quention why? Why we have different ways of representing numbers; after all humans can easily work with the number 4 and the number 4.0 and do not need
completely different approaches to writting them (apart from '.' of course).
