title: Collections Python

Earlier in this book we looked at some Python built-in types such as string,
int, float, bools and complex. These are not the only built-in types in Python;
another group of built-in types are collectively known as collection types.
This is because they represent a collection of other types (such as a collection
of string, or integers).

A collection is a single object representing a group of objects (such as a list or
dictionary). Collections may also be referred to as containers (as they contain other
objects). These collection classes are often used as the basis for more complex
or application specific data structures and data types.

These collection types support various types of data structures (such as lists and maps)
and ways to process elements within those structures. This chapter introduces
the Python Collection types.

There are four classes in Python that provides container like behaviour; that
is data types for holding collections of other objects, these are:

- Tuples
- Lists (Lists hold a collection of objects that are ordered and mutable/changeable
  they are indexed and allow duplicate members.
- Sets
- Dictionary
