                  Schedule would be half in the morning in c and c++ for preparation for school in the upcoming spring semester.Yep I am going to school again
                  in Computer Science<em>(I am not smart btw)</em>.Will continue the day on the exercises , "ruby the hard way" and exercism.Then just browse through different resources to enhance knowledge related to "Internet of things/IoT"
                  and so on.Check out the best reference for c++ <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">ðŸ‘‰ here ðŸ‘ˆ</a>.This time I will be using much more on VS code, since I am not familiar with this editor,more comfortable with atom even atom
                  boots up really slow.
