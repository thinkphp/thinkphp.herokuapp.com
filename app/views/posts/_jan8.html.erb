                Learning goal for this day is to to really learn deeply on applying test and integrate javascript on a rails application.But I still have a long way
                to go for my journey from being novice to advance then eventually to be something really good at.It takes time my friend, nothing really is achievable
                in a short period of time: unless your a prodigy with extraordinary talent from the day you were born.
